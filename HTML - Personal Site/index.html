    <h1><strong>What are we going to talk in this page?</strong></h1>
    <p>Well.. I <em><strong>love</strong></em> books, so I thought it was a good idea to indicate some of them and comment a little.</p>
    <h1>Sooo....<strong>Let's get started!</strong></h1>
    <h2>The red queen</h2>
    <p>The book "The Red Queen" is one of the best I have ever read. <br>It is about a kingdom that is divided by two types of blood:<br> silver (a blood that has powers) and red (a "normal" blood).<br> One day, a red-blooded girl called "Mare",
      enters the royal castle like a cleaning lady,<br> in order to overthrow the silver ones from power, but discovers that she had secret powers,<br> letting several problems get in the way of her true objective...</p>
    <h2>Queen of Hearts</h2>
    <p>This book is about the Queen of Hearts' point of view of her past <br> and the misfortunes that have occurred for her to change completely.</p>
    <h2>the selection</h2>
    <p>"The selection" was the <strong> best book I have ever read!</strong><br> He tells the story about a bunch of girls who are selected to try to win the prince's heart.<br> This story also contains a forbidden love,<br> an inevitable love <br>
      and a choice of love.</p>
    <h2>Twilight</h2>
    <p>I really liked Twilight, it's very similar to the movie,<br> however, reading this book attracts you and you can't stop reading,<br> which is very different from the movies.The story is about a vampire who falls in love with a mortal.<br> Well
      that's basically all I have to say about this book ...</p>
    <h2>Harry Potter</h2>
    <p>Well... I don't think i have anything to say..<br>everyone knows the Harry Potter's stories .. so what I have left are the criticisms.<br> hmmm I thought Harry Potter really cool <br> and it seems like Twilight, it draws you a lot to read, but
      <br> I don't recommend this book for people who like romance or mystery more.
    </p>
    <h2>Percy Jackson;</h2>
    <h2>and</h2>
    <h2>the heroes of Olympus;</h2>
    <p>Well, I'm going to talk about these two books together because,<br> even though they are from different collections, they have the same characters and the same story line.<br><em><strong>I LOVED</strong></em> these two books, I found them
      surprisingly good,<br> they are about the children of the Greek Gods, <br>and <em><strong>I HIGHLY</strong> </em>recommend them to people who like or find mythology interesting.</p>
